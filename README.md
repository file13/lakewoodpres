# lakewoodpca

A Clojure library designed to generate the church school's website,
lakewoodpca.com. I'm putting the code here in case someone else needs to take it over.

## Usage

Once you have lein installed, simply run:

lein run

in the main directory (the same location as the README). This will generate the
appropiate html files in the resources directory.
