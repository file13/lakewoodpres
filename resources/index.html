It is a ministry of the Lakewood Presbyterian Church (PCA) and operates under the authority of the Session, the governing board, of that Church. The Church is committed to the Westminster Confession of Faith, together with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms. Under the Bible, these provide the perspective from which we teach. The pastor of the Church is also the headmaster of the school. Teachers are approved by the Session.</p></div><ul><li><h2><a href="#">PERSPECTIVE <span class="last">AND PURPOSE</span></a></h2><p>God has given to parents and to the Church the responsibility to teach their children. The Bible states the goal of the nurture of children in several ways: to love God with heart, mind, soul and strength; to possess and grow in wisdom; to be disciples who observe all things that the Lord commanded them; to exercise a godly dominion over creation; to take every thought captive to Christ; to love their neighbor as themselves; and to be conformed to the image of Christ.</p><p>At the heart of the task of Christian education are God’s Word, the Bible, and instruction in it. It is God’s authoritative statement of truth. Skills must be developed and understanding gained in light of God’s Word. Christian education must develop the natural and spiritual gifts of the students. It needs to impart to the students an understanding of God’s world, His creation, which He sovereignly rules and governs for our good and His glory. And it should advance the students’ understanding of the hearts of men.</p><p>Lakewood Presbyterian School does not presume to accomplish this task alone. It assumes that the student’s family and Church will carry the primary weight of spiritual formation. The school intends to conduct the intellectual training of its students in ways consistent with and supportive of the long Christian tradition of the West and practices of faithful parents and Churches.</p><p>The experience of twenty years of conducting the school has shown us that the best predictor of the success of a student at  Lakewood is his discipline.  A sufficient combination of self-discipline and parentally  imposed discipline will be necessary to complete the required work</p></li><li><h2><a href="#"><span class="last">PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS</span></a></h2><p>Experience has shown us that the best predictor of the success of a student at Lakewood is his discipline.
