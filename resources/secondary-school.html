We conduct a theatre class, secondary choir, and journalism class throughout the year at times outside of our regular hours.</p><h4>THE SCHOOL MAINTAINS TRANSCRIPTS ONLY FOR 9th THROUGH 12th GRADES.</h4><br><br><h1>SECONDARY CURRICULUM</h1><p>The secondary classes (grades 7 – 12) aim at understanding and expression in the various subjects.</p><br><ul><li>Literature and History: These classes all include composition. They proceed through the following eras: Biblical (7th and 8th); Classical, Patristic, and Medieval (9th and 10th); and Reformation, Enlightenment, and Modern (11th and 12th).</li><br><li>Science: The classes are: Horticulture (7th and 8th), Physical Science and Biology (9th and 10th), and Chemistry and Physics (11th and 12th).</li><br><li>Mathematics: We use the Saxon textbooks and place the student according to his mathematical competence rather than by grade level. The courses range from pre-algebra through analytical geometry and trigonometry.</li><br><li>Latin: The Latin classes progress from learning the rudiments of the language through reading the literature of classical and ecclesiastical Latin.</li><br><li>Music: Two levels of classes involve students in the fundamentals of music and its history through appreciation and participation.</li></ul><h4>We conduct a drama class, select choir, athletics and a student produced yearbook throughout the year at times outside of our regular hours.</h4><p>The school maintains transcripts only for high school level work, which can count towards graduation.</p><br><br><h1>STUDENT RULES FOR GRADES 7 – 12</h1><h4>Cheating Policy</h4><p>If a teacher discovers that a student has plagiarized on a paper or cheated on a test, the student will be given an F for that trimester’s grade in that class.   We accept Webster’s definition of plagiarism: “The appropriating and putting forth as one’s own ideas, language, or designs of another.” Any source used must be credited. Students need to realize that teachers can and do search the internet to find sources the students may illegitimately use. Less severe, but still painful, penalties will be applied to cheating in smaller assignments or on quizzes. Being in possession of tests given in previous years and using them to prepare for a test is not permitted.   Students are required to follow the rules of any test or assignment.   Teachers do not discipline for cheating based upon the testimony of the students. It must be based upon the teacher’s own observation. However, if a student becomes aware of cheating on a paper or a test that the teacher has not observed, we ask that the student report to the teacher that there was cheating, but not to name the offender.   The teacher will not ask for the name.</p><br><h4>Students are not permitted to use cell phones or other electronic devices capable of recording or providing information (dedicated calculators excepted) in class. A ringing or vibrating phone will be confiscated and only returned to the parent. If used for cheating, the phone will be permanently confiscated and all student phones will be banned from the building.</h4><br><h4>Appearance Policy</h4><br><p>All students: No inappropriate language or images on clothing, no visible tattoos, no writing or drawing with ink on the skin or clothing, no body jewelry (except one earring per ear on girls), no hats worn inside, no unnatural hair color, no ratty clothing.</p><br><p>Ladies: skirts or dresses to mid-knee or longer (even with tights or leggings), no shorts, no tank tops, opaque blouses long enough to be tucked in, with the collar touching the base of the neck. (Touch the collarbone. Cloth – good; skin – too low.)</p><br><p>Gentlemen: no shorts, no tank tops, opaque shirts long enough to be tucked in, with the collar touching the base of the neck (see above), pants worn above the hips.</p><br><p>We can think of additional rules, if necessary. If you are inappropriately dressed, you will be given the option of returning home immediately (an unexcused absence) or purchasing from the school and putting on acceptable clothing (if available). Repeated offenders will receive more severe penalties.</p><br><h4>Excused Absence Policy</h4><br><p>An excused absence entitles a student to turn in, upon his return, work due while he was absent and to take tests given during his absence on his first day back.   If an absence is unexcused, neither of these privileges is granted.   A zero is given for worked missed due to an unexcused absence.   An excused absence does not restore the opportunity to receive credit for classroom participation, daily quizzes, or science labs that were missed.   If a student takes an unexcused absence written work may be turned in on time, either by another person or by email to a teacher, for credit to be given. The responsibility for such alternate delivery rests with the student.</p><br><p>LPS will excuse only those absences that we consider necessary. To receive an excuse for an absence the student must return to school with a completed Request for Excused Absence Form, which must be presented to and approved by the Headmaster. This form is available in the office or may be downloaded from the school’s website (www.lakewoodpres.com).</p><br><p>Optional absences will not be excused. The form indicates absences we regard as necessary and allows for the possibility that we have not thought of all of them.   We make explicit that an illness, to be an excuse for an absence, must keep the student inside at home all day, with the exception of a trip to the doctor.    If seeking an excused absence for reasons other than those explicitly stated on the form, the parent should consult with the Headmaster ahead of time.</p><br><p>The student is free to take optional absences, but will not be allowed to turn in work late as though on time or to make up missed tests. Parents are advised to consult the school calendar before planning trips and to keep in mind the daily schedule before making medical or dental appointments. These appointments will only be excused if it is not possible to be seen outside of school hours.</p><br><p>**This form must be given to and signed by Mr. Robertstad only before returning to class.</p><br><p>Download <a href="files/ExcusedAbsences11.pdf">HERE.</a></p><br><br><h1>GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</h1><p>Below are the requirements for graduation from Lakewood Presbyterian School. To avoid misunderstandings and to preserve the integrity of a diploma from the school, we consider it necessary to spell out clearly a set of standards that will need to be met. To graduate from L.P.S., a student must:</p><br><ol><li>Earn 20 credits in grades 9-12. Each trimester of literature and history classes is worth one-half credit. Each trimester of all other classes is worth one-third credit. Only math classes Algebra 1 and above count towards graduation. (They are awarded credit even if passed before ninth grade.) Except as limited below, these credits may be earned at L.P.S. or transferred from another school (including home school and private lessons in the arts, athletics, or other subjects). A written record from the responsible persons, school, tutor, or parents must be submitted to Lakewood Presbyterian School by the beginning of the senior year for us to acknowledge these credits. As a guideline for private lessons, treat as a full credit any class that involves three or more hours of instruction per week for the school year; as a half-credit a class that requires less than three hours of instruction per week for the school year.</li><br><li>Have among the 20 credits in grades 9-12 at least two high school level credits in each of these subject areas: mathematics (Algebra 1 & Algebra 2), history, science, literature, and foreign language.</li><br><li>Provide written notice before the beginning of the senior year of intent to graduate.</li><br><li>Earn at least 3 credits at Lakewood Presbyterian School in the senior year, which must include the three history and literature classes.</li><br><li>Take PSAT test as a junior and the SAT as a senior. No minimum score is required.</li><br><li>Be clear of material obligations to the school (e.g. tuition, returned books).</li><br><li>The student may not graduate ahead of the class with which he was admitted.</li></ol><br><br><h1>SECONDARY SCHOOL ELECTIVES</h1><p>As you consider your student’s school schedule, please review these elective programs and classes which occur outside the normal Tuesday through Friday morning schedule.  These programs are favorable additions for a rich high-school transcript.  To enroll your child, please review the requirements, and complete the response form, which you can download <a href="files/SecondaryResponseForm1.pdf">HERE.</a>  In order for a student to receive academic credit for Basketball, Choir, or Theatre, he must participate for the entire school year or sports season.  No credit is given for any trimester if the student does not complete the year.</p><br><ul><li>Basketball – Participation in the sports program does not involve try-outs; everyone is welcome to take part on the school teams.  During the basketball season, which is mid-October through February, teams practice three to four afternoons a week with no practices on game days.  There are usually two games per week, only one of which is held on a school night.  No games or practices are held on Wednesdays.  Uniforms are the property of the school, are assigned to players, and are collected at the end of the season.  Students in 9th through 12th grades receive one credit per year and the grade for this class is averaged in with the total transcript.  Grades are based upon participation.  There will be a  monthly athletic fee to cover costs.  We have not yet established the amount, but our best guess is that it will be approximately $60.00 per month during the season from October through February.  Current plans include junior high boys and girls and varsity boys and girls basketball teams.</li><br><li>Choir – This class is held on Thursday afternoons at 12:00pm and is open to 7th through 12th grade students upon audition and invitation.  Students in 9th through 12th grades receive one credit per year.  Grades are based upon participation.   There are no fees charged to take this class.</li><br><li>Princeps – This volunteer service program meets at least twice monthly on Tuesday afternoons from 12:00pm to 1:30pm and is open to all 7th through 12th grade students.  Although no transcript credit is given for this work, students in 9th through 12th grades receive confirmation of their participation in the group’s activities.  This program seeks to foster leadership through service.  One of the primary projects of Princeps will be the production of the yearbook.</li><br><li>Theatre – This class is held on Wednesday afternoons from 12:00pm until approximately 3:30pm and is open to all 7th through 12th grade students.  Students in 9th through 12th grades receive one credit per year.  Grades are based upon class and production participation.   Our main purpose in this class is the production of the winter and spring plays.  Opportunities for those who wish to work behind the scenes are also available.   Participation in the set-up and striking of the stage is mandatory in order to pass the class and will include time outside of the Wednesday afternoon schedule.  There are no fees charged to take this class.</li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div><div id="connect"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lakewood.presbyterian"><img alt="" src="images/icon-facebook.gif"></a> <a href="#"><img alt="" src="images/icon-twitter.gif"></a> <a href="#"><img alt="" src="images/icon-youtube.gif"></a> </div><div class="section"><ul><li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><li><a href="about.html">About Us</a></li><li><a href="admissions.html">Admissions</a></li><li><a href="elementary.html">Elementary</a></li><li><a href="secondary-school.html">Secondary School</a></li><li><a href="lps-extras.html">LPS Extras</a></li><li class="last"><a href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a></li></ul><p>Copyright © <a href="#">lakewoodpres.com</a> - All Rights Reserved</p></div></div></div></div></body></html></html>
