Our four and five year old kindergarten class is a one or two year program, depending upon the age a child enrolls. Children will be accepted based upon the school’s determination of a child’s readiness. In kindergarten and grades 1st and 2nd, phonics, reading and writing skills, and math are the main subjects taught. Science, history, geography, music , and art are introduced. A weekly music class teaches singing and enjoyable rhythmic activities. The children get to perform in music programs twice a year. Once a week the boys have a sports class while the girls take ballet. There is a ballet recital each spring.</p><br><p>In the 3rd through 6th grades, the subjects are math, English, history and geography, and science. In math, we use the Saxon curriculum. English emphasizes grammar and the reading of classical literature. History and geography are taught from a classical Christian world view. We survey history from biblical to modern times, noting major people, events, and dates. We teach both United States and world geography. In science, we begin the exploration of God’s creation. Art is integrated into various classes. A weekly music class prepares the students for public programs in the winter and spring.</p><br><h1>ELEMENTARY SUPPLY LIST</h1><p>Parents, please go over the supply list and make sure that each day your child comes to class prepared.</p><h4>All elementary students please bring on the first day of school the following:</h4><ul><li>One roll of paper towels</li><li>One box of kleenex</li><li>One package of sanitizing wipes</li></ul><h4>Kindergarten – Materials supplied by school (please, no backpacks, snacks, or toys except on Show & Tell Day)</h4><h4>1st & 2nd grades –</h4><ul><li>a small to medium sized sturdy backpack</li><li>school will provide other materials including tablet paper, art supplies, and filled pencil and crayon boxes for each child</li><p>Please buy and maintain the following at home in order to complete homework:</p><ul><li>½” tablet paper, #2 lead pencils, crayons, glue, and scissors</li><li>1st grade – addition & subtraction flashcards</li><li>2nd grade – addition, subtraction, & multiplication flashcards</li></ul></ul><h4>3rd & 4th grades –</h4><ul><li>a large, sturdy backpack</li><li>2 pk wide ruled notebook paper (this paper will be collected for in-class assignments only, please buy extra for your own work throughout the year)</li><li>pens – dark blue or black, only (3rd grade optional or erasable)</li><li>red checking pencil or pen</li><li>thin markers</li><li>ruler</li><li>colored pencils</li><li>protractor and compass (3rd graders only)</li><li>scissors</li><li>glue stick</li><li>crayons</li><li>pencil bags</li><li>pencils (students need to come to school each day with at least 3 sharpened pencils)</li><li>binders will be supplied for the 3rd through 6th grades.

Please look over the attached map which explains traffic flow and pick-up procedures.  This carpool is for pick-up only and mandatory for all elementary students, kindergarten through sixth grade.  Families with both elementary and secondary students need to arrange with their secondary children where they will pick them up.  If no family arrangements are made, the secondary students will be instructed to stand outside in the front of the building. Here are the procedures:<ul><br><li>Each family is receiving several 'name' cards.  Please place one in each vehicle that is used to pick up your child.  They should be placed in the driver side window so the carpool volunteer can clearly see the name.</li><br><li>Please follow the times carefully.  Carpool will begin at 11:50 and should run until no later than 12:05.  Please realize that you are responsible to be in the carpool lane at 11:50.   If for some reason you are not able to be in the carpool lane at that time, please ask a friend to pick up your children and hold them until you are able to be there.</li><br><li>If someone else is picking up your child and does not have a “name” card. please call the office and let us know who will be picking up your child.</li><br><li>If you need to go into the school for some reason, please arrive at school a little early, park in the side lot, and enter the school.  You can then pick your child up from the foyer where he will be waiting.</li><br><li>If you need to speak to your child’s teacher, please call the school office during school hours and set up an appointment, or email the teacher to do so.</li><br></ul></p><br><h1>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUMMER READING</h1><h4>Entering Kindergarten</h4><ul><li>No required books.
