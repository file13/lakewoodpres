Children must be four by July 1st to begin the four year old kindergarten and five to start our five year old kindergarten. Children will be accepted based upon the school’s determination of a child’s readiness. In kindergarten and grades one and two, phonics, reading and writing skills, and math are the main subjects taught. Science, history, geography, music, and art are introduced. A weekly music class teaches singing and enjoyable rhythmic activities. The children get to perform in music programs twice a year. Once a week the boys have a sports class while the girls take ballet.</p></div><div><h2>3RD THROUGH 6TH GRADES</h2><p>In the middle and upper elementary grades the subjects are:<ul><li><h4>Arithmetic:</h4>We use the Saxon curriculum. We place each
student according to his math level.</li><li><h4>English:</h4>We emphasize grammar and the reading of classical literature.<p></p></li><li><h4>History and Geography:</h4>This is taught from a classical Christian worldview. We survey history from biblical to modern times, noting major people, events, and dates. We teach both United States and world geography.</li><li><h4>Science:</h4>We begin the exploration of God’s creation.</li><li><h4>Art:</h4>Art is integrated into various classes. A weekly music class prepares the students for public programs in the winter and spring.</li></ul></p></div><div><h2>7th THROUGH 12TH GRADES</h2><p>The secondary classes (grades 7 – 12) aim at understanding and expression in the various subjects.<ul><li><h4>Literature and History:</h4>These classes all include composition. They proceed through the following eras: Biblical (7th and 8th); Classical, Patristic, and Medieval (9th and 10th); and Reformation, Enlightenment, and Modern (11th and 12th).</li><li><h4>Science:</h4>The classes are: Horticulture (7th and 8th), Physical Science and Biology (9th and 10th), and Chemistry and Physics (11th and 12th).<p></p></li><li><h4>Mathematics:</h4>We use the Saxon textbooks and place the student according to his mathematical competence rather than by grade level. The courses range from pre-algebra through analytical geometry and trigonometry.</li><li><h4>Latin:</h4>The Latin classes progress from learning the rudiments of the language through reading the literature of classical and ecclesiastical Latin..</li><li><h4>Music:</h4>Two levels of classes involve students in the fundamentals of music and its history through appreciation and participation.</li></ul><br><br><p>We conduct a drama class, select choir, athletics and a student produced yearbook throughout the year at times outside of our regular hours.</p><p>The school maintains transcripts only for high school level work, which can count towards graduation.</p></p></div><div><h2>THE SCHEDULE</h2><p>The school year is divided into trimesters that begin the Tuesday after Labor Day and continue through the fourth week of May. Vacations include the week of Thanksgiving, three weeks at Christmas, the week between Palm Sunday and Easter, Texas Independence Day, and a day in early May for the school play. Additional days off may be announced as needed.</p><br><p>Classes meet between 8:00am and 12noon, Tuesday through Friday. Our classes utilize a pairing of grades (i.e. 1st & 2nd, 3rd & 4th, etc.). Due to the shorter school day, we place a heavier emphasis on homework than would a daylong school. The homework is lighter in the lower grades, but increases as the student matures.</p></div><div><h2>FINANCES</h2><p>Tuition: Both elementary and secondary tuition will be $230.00 a month for 9 months. A $20 discount is given for second and subsequent students in the same family.</p><br><p>Student Fee: All students will pay a general fee of $460.</p><br><p>The payments are due for continuing students as follows:</p><br><ul><li>1st payment of ½ Fee due May 1st – $230</li><br><li>2nd payment of ½ Fee due June 1st – $230</li><br><li>First Tuition payment due July 1st – $230</li><br><li>Second Tuition payment due August 1st – $230</li><br></ul><p>Tuition payments are due the first school day of each month thereafter through March.</p></div><div><h2>ENROLLMENT PROCESS</h2><p>Inquiries about admission should be made to the office of the school. Prospective parents will set an appointment to observe the school. Then, parents must submit applications for all students and transcripts, for secondary students entering the 10th, 11th, or 12th grades. An interview with the elementary admissions director or headmaster, including placement testing (if needed), will be conducted. If mutually acceptable, parents, students, and the school official will sign the enrollment covenant and the parents will pay the student fees and the first month’s tuition, at which time the student(s) may be considered enrolled. All monies paid are non-refundable.</p></div><div><h2>STUDENT CODE OF BEHAVIOR</h2><p>Student behavior will be held to the standard of the Law of God, as expressed summarily in the two great commandments and in the Ten Commandments. While each individual is responsible for his own behavior, those in positions of authority (the teachers and administrators of the school) are also responsible “to endeavor that it (what is forbidden or commanded to ourselves) may be avoided or performed by others, according to the duty of their places.” Larger Catechism, 99</p><br><p>For this reason the faculty of the school will work with the student in keeping with the Larger Catechism, 129:</p><br><p class="span big-quote">It is required of superiors, according to that power they receive from God, and that relation wherein they stand, to love, pray for, and bless their inferiors: to instruct, counsel, and admonish them; countenancing, commending, and rewarding such as do well, and discountenancing, reproving,  and  chastising such as do ill; protecting and providing for them all things necessary for soul and body; and by grave, wise, holy and exemplary carriage, to procure glory to God, honor to them-selves so to preserve that authority which God hath put upon them.</p><br><h4>Of the students the following is expected:</h4><p><ul><li>The honor which inferiors owe to their superiors is, all due reverence in heart, word, behavior; prayer and thanksgiving for them; imitation of their virtues and graces; willing obedience to their lawful commands and counsels; due submission to their corrections; fidelity to, defense and maintenance of their persons and authority, according to their several ranks, and the nature of their places; bearing with their several ranks, and the covering them, in love, so that they may be an honor to them and to their government. Larger Catechism, 127</li><br><li>Attitudes and behavior to be avoided by students include: The sins of inferiors against their superiors are, all neglect of the duties required toward them; envying at, contempt of, and rebellion against their persons and places, in their lawful counsels, commands and corrections; cursing, mocking, and all such refractory and scandalous carriage, as proves a shame and dishonor to them and their government. Larger Catechism, 128</li><li>Students will always be on their honor to do their work according to the rules of the assignment.</li><br><li>The elementary grades (K – 6) are required to wear uniforms.</li><br><li>The dress of secondary students is regulated to this extent:</li><br><li>Girls: Blouses or sweaters must be long enough to be tucked in. They must be opaque. Shirts must come to the base of the neck. Dresses or skirts must be to mid-knee. Slacks must be worn at the waist; leggings are not considered trousers or pants but hosiery. Shorts are not permitted.</li><br><li>Boys: Shirts must be long enough to be tucked in. They must be opaque. No “tank tops.” Pants must be worn at the waist. Shorts are not permitted.</li><br><li>Radios, MP3 players, tape players, CD players, cell phones and other electronic devices (excepting calculators and computers) may not be brought into the school.</li><br></ul></p><h4>Particular instructions may be given for situations not covered by these rules.</h4><p>By accepting enrollment in the school the student is giving his willing consent to be held to these standards under the ministry of the faculty. Should discipline beyond the verbal prove necessary, the student may expect to be removed from class or sent home. Upon major breaches of the standards or contumacious behavior, the student may (after conference with parents) be suspended or expelled.</p></div><div><h2>PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS</h2><p>Experience has shown us that the best predictor of the success of a student at Lakewood is his discipline. A sufficient combination of self-discipline and parentally imposed discipline will be necessary to complete the required work.</p></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div><div id="connect"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lakewood.presbyterian"><img alt="" src="images/icon-facebook.gif"></a> <a href="#"><img alt="" src="images/icon-twitter.gif"></a> <a href="#"><img alt="" src="images/icon-youtube.gif"></a> </div><div class="section"><ul><li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><li><a href="about.html">About Us</a></li><li><a href="admissions.html">Admissions</a></li><li><a href="elementary.html">Elementary</a></li><li><a href="secondary-school.html">Secondary School</a></li><li><a href="lps-extras.html">LPS Extras</a></li><li class="last"><a href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a></li></ul><p>Copyright © <a href="#">lakewoodpres.com</a> - All Rights Reserved</p></div></div></div></div></body></html></html>
